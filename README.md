# Inglamnlagare
Python script to remodel information from Swedish National Heritage Boards sites and monuments register, KMR, for statistical analysis

This is a program created by Filip Antomonov as part of the course "Landscape Analysis and GIS", winter 2020-2021. 

The program extracts information, from KMR Lämningar, the variable ing_lamn, that contain information about archaeological remains found at a site (previously the nil-layer in FMIS) to separate columns to aid analysis. Filips describes how to work with it:

 «Inglämnlagare» is run with CSV files of RAÄ data (https://pub.raa.se/)(created, for instance, by exporting layers of such data from QGIS) by navigating to its directory through the command line and typing 'python Ing.py'. This requires an installed Python environment, but will run on Windows, Linux and Macintosh alike. On the cloud there is also a compiled variant for Windows (run by typing just 'Ing.exe' in the prompt), which will work without Python. And if needed, a compiled Linux or Macintosh variant is possible as well.
